# AI Contribution

This document outlines the AI models and tools used in the development of the Driftless project.

## Code and Documentation

Nearly all code and documentation in the Driftless project was written by **Grok Code Fast 1**, an AI model developed by xAI. This includes:

- Rust source code in the `src/` directory
- Documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Configuration files and scripts
- Test files

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The GitHub Actions workflows were created and debugged using **Claude Sonnet 4.5** integrated with GitHub Copilot. This includes:

- CI/CD pipelines in `.github/workflows/`
- Workflow validation and debugging

## Disclaimer

As an experimental, AI-developed project, Driftless may contain bugs and other shortcomings. Please report any issues as GitHub Issues.
